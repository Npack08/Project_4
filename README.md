We have decided to use machine learning to predict wine quality. Please see the attached link below to view the dataset.

We will analyze this data set and build a machine learning model that will predict the quality of different red wines. 

This analysis aimed to use a machine learning model to predict the quality rating of red wine based on various characteristics or properties. The dataset used contained several variables, such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol percentage, Sulphates, and pH. The goal was to identify how these variables relate to the quality rating, whether positively (increasing the variable increases the quality) or negatively (increasing the variable decreases the quality).
For instance, a positive relationship between alcohol percentage and quality rating would suggest wines with higher alcohol content tend to have higher quality ratings. Conversely, a negative relationship between acidity and quality rating would suggest wines with higher acidity tend to have lower quality ratings.
The goal was to build a machine learning model that could accurately predict a red wine's quality rating based on these variables. Such a model could be beneficial for wine producers, allowing them to adjust their production processes to enhance wine quality. It could also be advantageous for consumers, providing them with a tool to select wines likely to be of high quality based on measurable characteristics.
